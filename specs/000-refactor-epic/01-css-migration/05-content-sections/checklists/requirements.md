# Specification Quality Checklist: Content Sections & Final Cleanup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) -- *Exception: Technical Refactor task requires file-level specificity.*

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) -- *Exception: Success is defined by technical state.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification -- *Exception: Technical Refactor.*
