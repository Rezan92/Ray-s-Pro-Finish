# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate Core Components to CSS Modules

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Strictly CSS Module conventions, which is the requirement.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - *Focuses on isolation and maintainability.*
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - *Clear scenarios.*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - *Specific files listed.*
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - *100% of files, 0 regressions.*
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *Defined by outcome (hashed classes, isolation).*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec is ready for planning.
