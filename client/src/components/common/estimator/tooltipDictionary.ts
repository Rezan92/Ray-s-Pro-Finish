		"Any configuration defined in this section will be applied to all surfaces and rooms unless you customize the individual space card.",

		"Choose the finish that fits your project: \n• Pro-Base: Professional essential finish.\n• Standard: High-quality, eco-friendly 'Home Signature' finish.\n• Premium: 'Elite Performance' with superior durability.\n• Ultra Premium: Our luxury 'Masterpiece' finish for ultimate depth.\n(Note: If providing your own, please ensure you have enough for two full coats!)",
	COLOR_CHANGE_DARK_TO_LIGHT:
		"Changing from a dark color (like Navy) to a light color usually requires a specialized primer and a 3rd coat to ensure the old color doesn't 'bleed' through.",
	CEILING_POPCORN:
		"Popcorn ceilings are fragile. They require 'non-bridging' paint and a slower application to prevent the texture from falling off.",
	DOOR_PANELED:
		'Paneled doors take significantly longer to paint because each corner must be detailed by hand with a brush to prevent drips.',
	TRIM_CONVERSION:
		'Painting over wood-stain requires extensive preparation, including deep sanding, stain blocking, and multiple primer/finish coats to ensure a professional bond.',
